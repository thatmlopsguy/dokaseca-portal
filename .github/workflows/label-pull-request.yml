# This file defines the workflow for labeling pull requests with module tags based on the changed files in the PR.
# It uses the `actions/labeler` GitHub Action to achieve the same.
#
# The workflow is triggered on the `pull_request_target` event which ensures workflow is only run from the main branch.
# The job `labeler` runs on `ubuntu-latest` and has permissions to read contents and write pull requests.
#
# For more information on the `actions/labeler` GitHub Action, refer to https://github.com/actions/labeler
